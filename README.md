This is a slapped together set of failed demos.

The majority of the code is me just trying to get used to some of @thespite 's brilliant code, So I garuntee that if you think any part of this is cool, it is probably his code, not mine. Please Check out his work, because it will change the way you look at the web!


If there is part of it that you like let me know, and I will point you in the right direction, but using this code will only result in tears.
